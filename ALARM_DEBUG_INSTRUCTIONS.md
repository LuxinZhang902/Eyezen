# EyeZen Alarm System Debug Instructions

## Problem FIXED ✅
The "🚨 Alarm triggered:" log message was not appearing because the alarm intervals were set below Chrome's minimum allowed interval of 30 seconds (0.5 minutes). Chrome 120+ requires alarms to have a minimum interval of 30 seconds in production.

## Fix Applied ✅

### 1. Corrected Alarm Intervals
- Changed `DEFAULT_INTERVALS.BREAK_REMINDER` from 1 minute to 0.5 minutes (30 seconds)
- Added interval validation to ensure minimum 0.5 minutes
- Added proper error handling for alarm creation

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around alarm creation
- Added validation warnings for intervals below minimum
- Improved logging for successful/failed alarm creation

### 3. Service Worker Diagnostics (Already in place)
- Service worker startup logging
- Alarm listener registration verification
- Test alarm creation for immediate verification

## Testing Instructions ✅

### Step 1: Load the Fixed Extension
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the project directory
4. Note the extension ID

### Step 2: Verify Service Worker Console
1. In `chrome://extensions/`, find EyeZen extension
2. Click "service worker" link (or "Inspect views: service worker")
3. Look for these startup messages:
   - `📄 EyeZen Service Worker: Script loaded at [timestamp]`
   - `🚀 EyeZen Service Worker: Starting initialization...`
   - `🔧 Setting up alarm listener...`
   - `✅ Alarm listener registered`
   - `🧪 Creating test alarm to verify listener...`
   - `✅ Test alarm created successfully`

### Step 3: Test Break Reminder Alarm
1. Open the extension popup
2. Enable break reminders if not already enabled
3. Check the service worker console for:
   - `⏰ Setting up break reminder alarm` with interval details showing 0.5 minutes
   - `✅ Created break reminder alarm` confirmation
4. **Wait 30 seconds** and you should see:
   - `🚨 Alarm triggered: break-reminder`

### Step 4: Verify Test Alarm (Optional)
1. The service worker creates a test alarm on startup
2. Wait 30 seconds after loading the extension
3. You should see: `🧪 TEST ALARM TRIGGERED! Alarm listener is working correctly!`

### Step 5: Use Debug Tools (If needed)
1. Open `debug-alarm-system.html` in Chrome
2. Click "List All Alarms" to see active alarms
3. Verify alarms are created with proper intervals (≥ 0.5 minutes)

## Expected Behavior

If everything is working correctly, you should see:
1. Service worker loads and initializes
2. Test alarm triggers after 6 seconds with log: `🧪 TEST ALARM TRIGGERED!`
3. Break reminder alarms are created with 1-minute intervals
4. Break reminder alarms trigger every minute with log: `🚨 Alarm triggered: break-reminder`

## Common Issues

### Service Worker Not Loading
- Check if extension is properly loaded in `chrome://extensions/`
- Look for any JavaScript errors in service worker console
- Verify `background.js` file exists in build output

### Alarms Not Triggering
- Service worker might be going inactive (Chrome limitation)
- Check if alarm permissions are granted
- Verify alarms are being created with `chrome.alarms.getAll()`

### No Console Logs
- Service worker console is separate from page console
- Must check service worker DevTools specifically
- Service worker might not be running if no recent activity

## Next Steps if Still Not Working

1. Check service worker lifecycle and keep-alive strategies
2. Verify Chrome's alarm API limitations and minimum intervals
3. Test with longer alarm intervals (Chrome has minimum limits)
4. Consider using alternative timing mechanisms for very short intervals
