# EyeZen

**Privacy-first Chrome Extension for AI-powered eye wellness.**
Detects eye strain locally, guides refreshing eye breaks with AI coaching + Traditional Chinese Medicine massage, tracks progress, and keeps all data private.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Eye Strain Detection**: Real-time blink and fatigue detection (EAR/PERCLOS) using MediaPipe (WASM) in a Worker.
* **Break Rituals**: 20-20-20 rule reminders, TCM massage guide (Zan Zhu, Si Bai, Jing Ming), hydration nudge.
* **AI Coaching**: Varied break scripts via Writer/Rewriter API, weekly summaries via Summarizer API, multilingual support via Translator API.
* **Dashboard**: Daily KPIs, Eye Score, goals, history trends, privacy toggle.
* **Privacy**: Frames processed locally, no storage of images, only metrics saved.
* **Optional Hybrid**: Firebase sync, Gemini Cloud for personalized coaching letters.

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

* **Frontend/UI**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS, Recharts (charts), Vite + crxjs (build).
* **Extension Platform**: Chrome Extension Manifest V3.
* **State & Storage**: Zustand/Context, chrome.storage.local, IndexedDB.
* **Computer Vision**: MediaPipe Face Landmarker (WASM) for EAR/PERCLOS metrics.
* **AI APIs** (built-in Chrome APIs with Gemini Nano):

  * Writer/Rewriter API ‚Üí break coaching scripts.
  * Summarizer API ‚Üí weekly progress digest.
  * Translator API ‚Üí multilingual UI + scripts.
  * Prompt API multimodal (optional) ‚Üí lighting/distance suggestions.
* **Notifications/Timers**: Background service worker with chrome.alarms.
* **Audio**: Web Speech API (speechSynthesis) for break guidance.
* **Optional Cloud**: Firebase (sync history/goals), Gemini Cloud (rich summaries).

### Key Workflows

* **Eye Monitoring ‚Üí Break**: detect fatigue ‚Üí notification ‚Üí break screen with AI script, TCM guide, hydration nudge ‚Üí log events.
* **Weekly Summary**: load 7-day history ‚Üí Summarizer API ‚Üí dashboard digest card.
* **Goal Tracking**: create goal ‚Üí track daily progress ‚Üí streaks & completion bar.
* **Settings & Privacy**: toggle camera, adjust sensitivity, erase data.

### Scoring Model

* Base 70.
* +10 for ‚â•3 breaks, +5 for ‚â•1 massage, +5 if healthy blink rate.
* ‚àí10 for ‚â•4 fatigue alerts, ‚àí5 if >8h screen with insufficient breaks.
* Weekly/monthly = average of daily scores.

## üîí Privacy & Security

* Frames never stored; closed immediately after inference.
* Metrics-only cross Worker boundary.
* No host\_permissions; camera permission requested only on demand.
* Strict MV3 CSP.
* ‚ÄúErase all data‚Äù clears chrome.storage + IndexedDB.

## ‚ö° Prompt for AI Coding Agent
# Prompt for AI Coding Agent
Build a Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) called "EyeZen" using TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS. Using Python, Docker and K8S. The extension should:
1. Include a **Popup UI** with status (Good/Tired), a "Start Eye Break" button, and quick settings.
2. Implement a **Dashboard (Options page)** with daily KPIs, Eye Score, goal tracking, weekly summary (via Summarizer API), and settings.
3. Run a **CV Worker** using MediaPipe Face Landmarker (WASM) to compute EAR/PERCLOS from camera frames, outputting metrics (blinkRate, fatigueIndex, posture). Ensure frames are closed immediately.
4. Use a **Background service worker** with chrome.alarms to trigger 20-20-20 reminders and handle notifications. This is for when the user chooses not detect, but a set time of alarm
5. Integrate **Writer/Rewriter API** using OpenAI API to generate break coaching scripts, **Summarizer API** for weekly digests, and **Translator API** for multilingual support.
6. Break Ritual screen should show: 20-20-20 timer, TCM massage guide (Zan Zhu, Si Bai, Jing Ming) with simple animations, hydration nudge, and AI-generated script. Optionally, use Web Speech API for audio.
7. Store user data and events (alerts, breaks, massages, hydration) in chrome.storage.local + IndexedDB, with a simple scoring model (0-100).
8. Include privacy features: camera ON/OFF toggle, erase all data button, metrics-only storage.
9. Follow project structure: /extension (popup, options, background), /core (cv-worker, metrics, coach, storage), /ui (components, charts, assets).
10. Ensure strict CSP, minimal permissions, and MIT license. 

Make sure the code is clean with comments and documentation
