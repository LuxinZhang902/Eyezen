# Chrome Extension Reload Instructions

## Latest Update: Blink Rate Disabled

**IMPORTANT**: Blink rate has been removed from score calculation as it's always 0 in real-time scoring.

### Changes Made:
- **Blink Rate Weight**: 0.20 â†’ 0.00 (disabled)
- **EAR Weight**: 0.25 â†’ 0.30 (increased)
- **PERCLOS Weight**: 0.30 â†’ 0.35 (increased)  
- **Posture Weight**: 0.15 â†’ 0.25 (increased)
- **Fatigue Weight**: 0.10 (unchanged)

## Root Cause Analysis

The eye health scores were stuck around 41-43 due to:

1. **Blink Rate Issue**: Always 0 in real-time, dragging down scores
2. **Overly Strict Thresholds**: Previous EAR/PERCLOS thresholds didn't match real-world values
3. **Extension Caching**: Chrome extension needs manual reload after code changes

## Solution Steps

### 1. Rebuild and Reload Extension
1. **Rebuild**: Run `npm run build` (already completed)
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Find your "Eye Health Monitor" extension
4. Click the **refresh/reload** button (ðŸ”„) on the extension card
5. **Alternative**: Toggle the extension off and on again

### 2. Clear Extension Storage (Important!)
1. Right-click on the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Select "Inspect popup" or "Inspect"
3. In the DevTools console, run:
   ```javascript
   chrome.storage.local.clear()
   chrome.storage.sync.clear()
   ```
4. Close the DevTools and popup

### 3. Test the Updated Extension
1. Open the extension popup
2. Allow camera access if prompted
3. Look directly at the camera with good posture
4. Wait 10-15 seconds for metrics to stabilize
5. **Expected Results**: Scores should now be 70-90+ (blink rate no longer dragging down scores)

### 4. Verify Changes with Test Files
1. Open `test-improved-scoring.html` in your browser
2. Click "Test Current Real Values" - should show improved scores
3. Note: Blink rate will still show in components but won't affect overall score

## What Was Fixed

### Primary Issue: Blink Rate
- **Problem**: Blink rate was always 0 in real-time scoring, contributing 20% weight to drag down scores
- **Solution**: Disabled blink rate from calculation (weight = 0.00)
- **Impact**: Redistributed 20% weight to more reliable metrics

### Weight Redistribution:
- **EAR**: 0.25 â†’ 0.30 (+5%)
- **PERCLOS**: 0.30 â†’ 0.35 (+5%)
- **Posture**: 0.15 â†’ 0.25 (+10%)
- **Fatigue**: 0.10 (unchanged)
- **Blink Rate**: 0.20 â†’ 0.00 (disabled)

### Previous Fixes (Still Active):
1. **EAR Threshold**: 0.25 â†’ 0.28 (better real-world alignment)
2. **PERCLOS Threshold**: 0.15 â†’ 0.10 (more realistic)
3. **Fatigue Calculation**: Reduced penalties and capped impact

## Expected Results After Reload

- **Before**: Scores stuck around 41-43 (blink rate dragging down)
- **After**: Scores should be 70-90+ for good eye health
- **Key Change**: Blink rate no longer affects overall score
- **Components**: Eye strain and posture now have more influence

## Files Updated

- `core/metrics/index.ts`: Updated weights and calculation
- `test-improved-scoring.html`: Updated to match new calculation
- Extension rebuilt with `npm run build`

## Critical Next Steps

1. **MUST reload the Chrome extension** - new build needs to be loaded
2. **Clear extension storage** to remove cached data
3. **Test immediately** - should see significant score improvement

## If Issue Persists
1. Check the actual metric values in the console logs
2. Verify camera is detecting face landmarks correctly
3. Ensure posture detection is working (not stuck on 'poor')
4. Check if fatigue index is accumulating incorrectly

## Debug Files Created
- `debug-extension-scoring.html`: Test scoring calculations
- `test-improved-scoring.html`: Verify updated thresholds work
